"""Using X_train2 and y_train2 from the preceeding cell, train a DecisionTreeClassifier with default parameters. What are the 5 most important features found by the decision tree?

As a reminder, the feature names are available in the X_train2.columns property, and the order of the features in X_train2.columns matches the order of the feature importance values in the classifier's feature_importances_ property.

This function should return a serie of length 5 containing the feature names in descending order of importance."""
